"""
Programming language:Which is invented for humans as computer understand only 0 and 1 ,to make interactive to computer we use PL which can written in two type of language either low-level (equivalent language) or high-level(Python,javaScript,java etc) and this change to machine level language an interpreter or compiler is used . Note:all programming language do and give result.
Interpreter (translator):reads line by line instruction and converts to machine level code and excutes.
Compiler (translators):reads entire file at once and then converts to machine level code and executes.
Python is an interpreter language(which executes line-by-line) interpreters{(cpython(written in c popular one),jyhton(written in java) ,pypy(written in python itself))} by this it read the line by line and execute it. when we write the python code through interpreter it first convert source code to bytecode(which is machine-level code) and through virtual machine it shows us in the output screen.python file extension is (.py)  and which is slower than c,java.
But good at
1)easy to learn and productivity 
2)less line .
3)visualizing,processing ,webservice and many more.

ways to execute python code:
(replits )online 
1)Terminal:cmd prompt using python
2)code Editors:like visualStudioCode and sublimetext editor
3)IDEs(integrate development environment):like pycharm and spyder
4)Notebooks(for ML):like jupyter
version is about changing or enhancing the feature of programming language 
Python2 v/s Python3:
Guido van rossum developed python
python2:from starting of invention till 2008 python2 there later it evolve to python3 and it's legacy,has less community and security than python3.
python3 has changes of minor like print and  and this is popular one 
And all community moving to python3
Major diff between python2 and python3 are:
printing,division operator,unicode,xrange,errorHandling and future module.]
based on pros and cons of programming language to develop certain we choose programming language

#to print the name or anything
print("Rakesh")
#input() capture the information from user  with message inside it and can store in variable and print that with associated name
name=input("Enter you're name")
print("hello ",name)
